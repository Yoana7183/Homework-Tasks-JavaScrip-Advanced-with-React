//     Object basics 2

// In our next task, we want you to have a go at creating your own object literal to represent one of your favorite bands. The required properties are:

//     name: A string representing the band name.
//     nationality: A string representing the country the band comes from.
//     genre: What type of music the band plays.
//     members: A number representing the number of members the band has.
//     formed: A number representing the year the band formed.
//     split: A number representing the year the band split up, or false if they are still together.
//     albums: An array representing the albums released by the band. Each array item should be an object containing the following members:
//         name: A string representing the name of the album.
//         released: A number representing the year the album was released.

// Include at least two albums in the albums array.

// Once you've done this, you should then write a string to the variable bandInfo, which will contain a small biography detailing their name, nationality, years active, and style, and the title and release date of their first album.
